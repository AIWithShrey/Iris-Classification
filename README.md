# Iris-Classification

**This is an end-to-end Machine Learning program that I wrote with the help of 'Introduction to Machine Learning with Python' by O'Reilly. I used Scikit-learn and the K-nearest neighbor model.**

**This program was originally written in a Jupyter Notebook, so the code isn't very organized. However, you can download this code and tinker around until you understand the working of it.**

**Before running the code locally, you need to have the set of dependencies installed: Scikit-learn, pandas, numpy and mglearn**

**These dependencies can be installed using the 'pip3 install *enter name of dependency*' command in the terminal/command prompt**
